# uclaacm-rustlings

A collection of learning resources for Rust beginners as taught through the creation of a
line-counting toy project!

## Abstract

You will create a program to count lines of code (e.g., `wc -l`), eventually counting individual comments
and empty lines, before finally parallelizing your program to count lines in multiple files at once.
Counting lines may seem like a simple task, but it can involve a surprising amount of depth. This project
will give you a tour of the main features of Rust.

There are a handful of other programs out there that accomplish what this toy does. Take a look at them
to get a feel for what you’ll be making:
* https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei
* https://github.com/cgag/loc

## Goals

You will learn:
* Basics of Rust syntax
* Rust’s toolchain
* How to work with strings
* `std::fs`
* `std::fmt`
* `std::thread`

You should already know:
* Another programming language
* How to navigate and use your computer with a terminal

Lecture material (or at least additional resources for) the information required to create this project will be
provided in each part.
